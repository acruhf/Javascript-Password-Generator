# Javascript-Password-Generator
Homework 3- Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to create a password generator that can randomly generate a strong password. The nature of cybersecurity requires robust password systems that include multiple character types so that users can protect their information.
    The HTML and CSS style sheet were provided as a starting point for the Javascript. 
The program is mostly concerned with completing two basic tasks: accepting the password criteria as described by the user, and generating the password to fit those criteria. The user clicks a button to activate a series of alert prompts where the user describes the desired length of the password and which types of characters to use. If the user inputs a password length either too short or long, or selects no to every type of character, an alert will instruct the user to give valid inputs and reset the page.
The criteria requested by the user are then passed through the password generator function, which assembles the password from multiple random character generators of each character type: uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The results are displayed in the dialogue box in the center of the page.
